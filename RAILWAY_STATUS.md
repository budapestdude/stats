# Railway Deployment Status

## Current Situation

### ✅ What's Working
- Railway deployment environment is functional
- Minimal test server (`test-server.js`) deploys and runs successfully
- Railway Volume is mounted at `/app/data`
- Railway uses port `8080` (not 3007)
- Database downloads successfully from GitHub Release (124MB)

### ❌ What's Not Working
- Full application server (`simple-server.js`) fails to start (502 error)
- Application crashes before reaching `app.listen()`
- Cannot access Railway deployment logs from local environment

## Key Findings

1. **Port**: Railway uses port `8080`, not `3007`
   - Our code uses `process.env.PORT` correctly

2. **Volume Path**: `/app/data`
   - Database should download to `/app/data/railway-subset.db`

3. **Test Server Success**: Minimal Express server with no dependencies works
   - This proves Railway environment is functional
   - Issue must be in application code or dependencies

## Likely Causes of Failure

### 1. Database Copy to /tmp Failing
The server tries to copy 124MB database from volume to `/tmp`:
```javascript
fs.copyFileSync(volumeDbPath, tmpDbPath);  // May fail or timeout
```

**Possible issues**:
- `/tmp` size limit on Railway
- Copy takes too long, healthcheck times out
- Insufficient memory for copy operation

### 2. OTB Module Dependencies
Even with try-catch, the modules might have transitive dependencies that crash on require:
- `otb-database/download-manager.js`
- `otb-database/pgn-parser.js`
- `otb-database/game-moves-loader.js`
- `otb-database/advanced-analyzer.js`
- `otb-database/historical-analyzer.js`

### 3. SQLite3 Binary Issues
`sqlite3` might need native compilation for Railway's environment.

### 4. Startup Timeout
Railway might kill the process if it doesn't respond to healthchecks quickly enough.

## Next Steps (Recommended)

### Option 1: Simplify Database Handling (RECOMMENDED)
1. Don't copy database to `/tmp` - try to use volume directly
2. If that fails, skip database entirely for now
3. Make ALL database-dependent endpoints return mock data when db is null
4. Get server running first, then debug database separately

### Option 2: Access Railway Logs
You need to access Railway's deployment logs to see the exact error:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Select your project
3. Click backend service
4. View "Deployments" tab
5. Click latest deployment
6. View full logs to see crash reason

### Option 3: Add More Logging
Modify `simple-server.js` to add extensive console.log before every potentially failing operation:
```javascript
console.log('Step 1: Loading modules...');
// require statements
console.log('Step 2: Creating Express app...');
// Express setup
console.log('Step 3: Connecting to database...');
// database connection
console.log('Step 4: Starting server...');
// app.listen
```

## Recommended Fix

Update `simple-server.js` to skip database operations entirely if they fail:

```javascript
// Simplified database connection with complete fallback
let db = null;
try {
  if (volumeDbPath && fs.existsSync(volumeDbPath)) {
    // Try volume path directly first (no copy)
    db = new sqlite3.Database(volumeDbPath, sqlite3.OPEN_READONLY);
    console.log('✅ Database connected from volume');
  }
} catch (err) {
  console.warn('⚠️  Database not available:', err.message);
  console.log('   Server will run without OTB database');
  db = null;
}

// Remove ALL database copy logic
// Remove ALL OTB module requires
// Start server immediately
```

## Environment Variables Needed

Current Railway environment:
- `PORT=8080` (auto-set by Railway)
- `NODE_ENV=production` (auto-set)
- `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH=/app/data` (auto-set when volume attached)
- `DATABASE_DOWNLOAD_URL=https://github.com/budapestdude/stats/releases/download/database-v1/railway-subset.db`

## Files Modified in This Session

1. `simple-server.js` - Added error handling, /tmp copy logic
2. `download-db-from-url.js` - Downloads database from GitHub Release
3. `railway.json` - Deployment configuration
4. `test-server.js` - Minimal test server (WORKING)
5. `.gitattributes` - Removed Git LFS
6. `RAILWAY_DEBUG.md` - Debugging guide
7. `RAILWAY_STATUS.md` - This file

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Server starts successfully on Railway
- [ ] `/health` endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Database loads from volume (or gracefully skips if unavailable)
- [ ] API endpoints return data (even if mock data initially)
