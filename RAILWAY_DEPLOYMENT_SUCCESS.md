# Railway Deployment - SUCCESS! ‚úÖ

## Status: DEPLOYED AND WORKING

**Backend URL**: https://stats-production-10e3.up.railway.app
**Deployment Date**: October 11, 2025
**Database**: 500k games (124MB) from GitHub Release

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Server**: Running on Railway port 8080
2. **Health Endpoint**: Returns 200 OK
3. **Database**: Successfully loading from Railway Volume
4. **Player Search**: Working with OTB database data
5. **Error Handling**: Server stays running even with database errors

### Test Results
```bash
# Health check
curl https://stats-production-10e3.up.railway.app/health
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-10-11T13:45:24.923Z","message":"Chess Stats API is running!"}

# Player search (Magnus Carlsen found with 424 games)
curl "https://stats-production-10e3.up.railway.app/api/otb/database/players/search?q=magnus"
{"players":[{"name":"Carlsen, Magnus","totalGames":424, ...}], ...}
```

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Database Download
- `download-db-from-url.js` runs on startup
- Downloads `railway-subset.db` (124MB) from GitHub Release
- Saves to Railway Volume at `/app/data/railway-subset.db`
- Skips download if file already exists

### 2. Database Loading
- Copy database from volume to `/tmp` for SQLite write access
- Open in READ-ONLY mode
- Attach error handlers to prevent crashes
- Skip COUNT queries that require temp files

### 3. Error Handling
- Global `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection` handlers
- Database error events caught and logged (non-fatal)
- Server continues running even if database fails
- Optional OTB analysis modules loaded with try-catch

## üåê Environment Variables

Set in Railway dashboard:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `PORT` | 8080 | Auto-set by Railway |
| `NODE_ENV` | production | Auto-set by Railway |
| `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH` | /app/data | Auto-set with volume |
| `DATABASE_DOWNLOAD_URL` | https://github.com/budapestdude/stats/releases/download/database-v1/railway-subset.db | GitHub Release URL |

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Update Frontend
Configure frontend to use Railway backend:

**In Railway Frontend Service**:
- Set environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://stats-production-10e3.up.railway.app`
- Redeploy frontend

### 2. Remove Test Files (Optional)
Once confirmed stable:
```bash
git rm test-server.js RAILWAY_DEBUG.md RAILWAY_STATUS.md
git commit -m "Clean up test files"
```

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Check Railway metrics dashboard
- Monitor database query performance
- Consider adding Redis cache if needed

### 4. Upgrade Database (Optional)
To use full 9.1M game database instead of 500k subset:
1. Upload `complete-tournaments.db` to GitHub Release (may require Git LFS or chunking)
2. Update `DATABASE_DOWNLOAD_URL` environment variable
3. Delete volume file and redeploy to download new database

## üêõ Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: SQLITE_CANTOPEN on Startup
**Problem**: Database opened but COUNT queries crashed with SQLITE_CANTOPEN
**Solution**: Removed COUNT queries from startup, added error handlers

### Issue 2: Git LFS Limits
**Problem**: GitHub LFS has 2GB file limit and Railway doesn't support LFS
**Solution**: Use GitHub Releases (supports 2GB files) with direct download

### Issue 3: Volume Permissions
**Problem**: Railway volumes may not allow SQLite to write temp files
**Solution**: Copy database to `/tmp` which has write access

### Issue 4: Module Dependencies
**Problem**: OTB analysis modules might fail to load on Railway
**Solution**: Wrap all requires in try-catch, make modules optional

### Issue 5: Uncaught Exceptions
**Problem**: Database errors crashed entire server
**Solution**: Add global error handlers, attach database error listeners

## üìä Database Schema

The `railway-subset.db` contains:

### Tables
- `games` - 500,000 chess games with full PGN data
- `tournaments` - Tournament metadata
- `players` - Player profiles and statistics
- `openings` - Opening repertoire data

### Key Indexes
- Player names (for search)
- Tournament IDs
- Game dates
- ECO codes (opening classification)
