## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Analytics Engine**: `src/services/analytics-engine.js`
- **Routes**: `src/routes/analytics.js`
- **Database**: SQLite with 9.1M+ games
- **Connection Pooling**: 3-15 managed connections
- **Caching**: 10-minute TTL for expensive calculations

### Performance Optimizations
- Query result caching
- Connection pooling for database access
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Indexed queries for fast lookups
- Streaming for memory efficiency

### Key Algorithms
1. **ELO Rating System**
   - Standard FIDE formula implementation
   - Configurable K-factor support
   - Win probability calculations

2. **Style Classification**
   - Multi-dimensional scoring system
   - Pattern recognition in game outcomes
   - Opening repertoire analysis

3. **Performance Rating**
   - Weighted scoring system
   - Streak bonus calculations
   - Consistency factor integration

4. **Diversity Calculation**
   - Entropy-based diversity scoring
   - Opening variation analysis
   - Normalized 0-100 scale

## üìù Notes

- The analytics engine processes large datasets efficiently using connection pooling
- Player name searches are case-sensitive and must match database records exactly
- For optimal performance, limit player game queries to 1000 most recent games
- Cache invalidation occurs after 10 minutes for all analytics queries
- Tournament analytics work best with complete tournament data

## üîí Performance Considerations

- **Query Optimization**: Indexes on player names, dates, and tournaments
- **Memory Management**: Streaming for large result sets
- **Connection Pooling**: Prevents database connection exhaustion
- **Caching Strategy**: Reduces repeated expensive calculations
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple games efficiently
